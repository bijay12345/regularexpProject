# regularexpProject
This is basically a project given to me to showcase some basic concept that i have in 
python's framework django.

To make it work clone the file or just download the project in zip
unpack the zipped file.
open the project in a editor
cd into the project folder in terminal
type pip install -r requirements.txt
now type python manage.py runserver
good to go....
